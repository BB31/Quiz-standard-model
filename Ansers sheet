1.The mass of the photon is zero, because its massless. It is a electromagnetic force and there doesnt have mass.
2.The size of a quark of the quark is unknow since it is constantly moving and changes.
3.Color charge  is a property of quarks and gluons that is related to the particles strong interaction , while electrical charge 
is a charastic of a unit of a matter that expresses the extent to which it has more or fewer electron than proton, electro carries negatice charges 
and proton carries posetive charges.
4.The difference between a boson and a fermion is that fermion cannot occupy the same quantum space unlike boson andother difference is that 
the spin of Boson consist of integer (0,1,2 and so on) while the spin of fermion consist of half or not whole integer ( 1/2, 3/4 and so on)
5.Paricles that are both a boson and a hadron are Mesons( pions and kaons)when two particles interact using basic property of interaction
6.The bubble chamber is an appartus designed to make the tracks of ionizing particles visible as a row of bubbles in liquid.
7.Leptons are the elementary particles there isnt made up of anything of a smaller units than lepton since its one of the fundemental particles that makes up the world.
8.Examples of Leptons are Electron and Muon , while two examples of Baryons are proton and neutron.
9.For each point that which lines comes togheter in a feynmann diagram is called a vertex, Each vertec must conserve, charge, baryon number
and lepton number.
10. An example of an exchange particle is Gluon which act as a exchange particle for the strong force between quark, analogous to the exchange 
of photons in the electromagnet force between two charge.
